# Miracle - Pharmaceutical Intelligence Platform

A simple welcome page built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

I chose Tailwind CSS because it's highly customizable. With utility-first classes, I can easily:
- Modify colors, spacing, and layouts
- Create consistent design systems
- Build responsive interfaces quickly
- Customize the design to match any brand requirements

The utility-based approach makes it simple to adjust the visual design without writing custom CSS, while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.
